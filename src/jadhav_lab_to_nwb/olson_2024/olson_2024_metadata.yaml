      description: Recording of AC neural responses in mice performing this behavioral task will utilize dense 128-channel recording probes (Masmanidis Lab). These recording probes span a depth ~1mm, allowing for sampling of all layers of cortex. Electrophysiology data will be recorded using OpenEphys Acquisition Board v2.4 and associated OpenEphys GUI software.
