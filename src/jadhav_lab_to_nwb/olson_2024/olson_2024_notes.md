# Notes concerning the olson_2024 conversion

- Lots of folders w/ SpikeGadgets output: What does the folder naming convention mean?
- SL18_D19.DIO has a bunch of .dat files -- also SpikeGadgets?
- SL18_D19.ExportedUnitStats has a bunch of .txt files with unit properties
- SL18_D19.SpikesFinal has plexon files (.plx) -- from spike sorting?
- SL18_D19.yml has a bunch of useful neuroconv-style metadata
