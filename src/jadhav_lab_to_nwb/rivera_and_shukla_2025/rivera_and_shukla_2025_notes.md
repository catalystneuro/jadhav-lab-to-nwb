# Notes concerning the rivera_and_shukla_2025 conversion

## File Structure
- In Ashutosh's poster, there are 2 reward contingencies (50% and 100%) + an opaque control
- ratsamples doesn't follow the normal file structure, but just has a bunch of .csv files. What's going on there?
    - Looks like those .csvs are the only files that tabulate individual sessions and their outcomes (matched or not, etc.)
- In Ashutosh's poster, head orientation angle relative to partner's COM are calculated, but I don't see that anywhere in the data.
- Visual cue association task?
- probabilistic foraging task?
- Detailed subject info is present in Edward's Poster
